# Huffman Encoding Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator to visualize the Huffman Encoding algorithm. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **D3.js**, this tool allows users to input a custom string and see how Huffman coding generates efficient binary codes for characters based on frequency.

## 🚀 Features

- User input for any string message
- Real-time character frequency analysis
- Animated Huffman Tree construction using D3.js
- Live generation and display of Huffman Codes
- Reset button to clear and restart the simulation

## 📸 Demo

![Huffman Tree Animation] 
> Animation of tree generation and code assignment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 
- D3.js (v7.8.4)

## 📂 Project Structure


📁 Huffman-Encoding-Simulator/
├── index.html         # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css         # Styling for layout and visualization
├── script.js          # Main Huffman algorithm and animation logic


## 🔍 How It Works

1. User enters a message.
2. Characters are counted and sorted by frequency.
3. A binary tree is constructed step by step.
4. Huffman codes are generated from the tree paths.
5. Codes are displayed in a table for reference.

## 📦 Setup

You can run it locally without any server:


git clone  https://github.com/MrMajharul/Huffman-Encoding-Simulator.git

```

> Make sure you have internet access to load the D3.js CDN.

## 🎯 Use Case

This tool is ideal for:

- Computer Science presentations
- Algorithm visualization
- Educational demos for data compression
